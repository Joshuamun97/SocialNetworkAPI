## Description
An API utilizing mongodb and MVC configuration. In this project, we were to build an API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friendsâ€™ thoughts, and create a friend list.

## Usage
This is amazing starter code for any company looking to either start a social media website, or just impliment a "social" aspect to their existing site. Here is a link to the walkthrough video: https://watch.screencastify.com/v/mpSmqgamSaPk4hyAU7d4
